# MacLimitVolume
A simple applescript to prevent people turning the volume on a mac too loud

If you export as an run only application then set as startup item then it can't be quit and works automaticly
It can however be force quit and I have yet to implement some why to prevent force quit

But this program is intented to be used for kids who proberbly do not know about force quit etc
